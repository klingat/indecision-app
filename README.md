# Indecision App

## Install the app

```
yarn install
```

## Running the app locally

```
yarn run web-server
```

Look at the output to see where your app is running.
You should see a line that says something like this: `Project is running at http://localhost:8080/`
In that case, open a window in your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`
